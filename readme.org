** idle game
the initial idea was to just create something that connects over tcp sockets and then they communicate, but then it evolved to a socket based approach to what is idlerpg on irc (pretty fun interactive gameplay)

** roadmap:
- [X] store user in db
- [X] make sure user only has 1 active connection
